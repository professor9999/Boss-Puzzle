# Boss-Puzzle
This is quite an old game which involves a 4*4 grid with numbers 1 to 15. The objective of this game is to slide the numbers in such a way that numbers can be arranged numerically. Built a program using the backtracking algorithm that could determine whether it was possible to solve a particular set of the grid and also finding the minimized way of doing so.

## Requirments

Download and run it using any of the standard C/C++ compiler

## Execution

1) Enter a 4*4 matrix by entering numbers ranging from 1 to 15 in any order along with a - that will signify the slider
2) Choose whether you want to try it manually or allow the program to solve it automatically
3) If choosen automatic, the program will utilize backtracking algorithm to optimally solve the puzzle
