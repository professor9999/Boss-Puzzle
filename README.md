# Boss-Puzzle
This is quite an old game which involves a 4*4 grid with numbers 1 to 15. The objective of this game is to slide the numbers in such a way that numbers can be arranged numerically. Built a program using the backtracking algorithm that could determine whether it was possible to solve a particular set of the grid and also finding the minimized way of doing so.
